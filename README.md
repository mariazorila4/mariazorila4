## 🤔 Who am I?


Well, my name is **Zorilă Maria Cristina**, a final-year student in **Economic Informatics** at ASE.

I’m a student who enjoys the "build and learn" process—whether that’s putting together a full-stack web app, diving into a research paper, or trying out new tech at a hackathon. I like finding practical solutions to problems using code.
Right now, I’m focusing on sharpening my skills in **Node.js, Express, and React** while keeping my foundation strong in SQL and Java. I’m excited to start my career, work on real projects, and connect with people who are as curious about tech as I am!
